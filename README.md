# Easy-Comment-TextMate-Bundle
TextMate bundle to give Sublime Text-esque comment completion. Currently, in order to auto add either an asterisk (for block 
comments) or a double slash (for single line comments), you must hit shift-enter. This jumps to the next line while keeping the
current indentation level.

I will keep this bundle up to date as I find things to add and make more efficient.
